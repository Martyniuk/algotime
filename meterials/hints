Hints:
1. If you trying to solve the issue more than 1 hour, look the best solutions.
Mark this problem as "TODO tomorrow", and do it tomorrow.
2. Write good examples on paper.
3. Write good readable solution on paper. Debug it manually with tricky input.
(for instance: list with only one item). Fix the bugs, make optimizations.
4. Write you code in IDE, it should work from the first time!!!
5. Write your explanation on comments, to make your solution obvious when you read it next time.
